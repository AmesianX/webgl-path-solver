        This maze is being solved entirely on your GPU as a 12-state
        cellular automata. All branches are searched in parallel
        (green) as they are discovered, leaving a trail of breadcrumbs
        pointing to the start (red). As soon as the end cell (red) is
        reached, a route is traced (blue) along the breadcrumb root
        back to the start. This final route trace would be better done
        on the CPU.
